      value: '<p>When it comes to building a reading list that will never go out of style, classics are always a safe choice. They’ve been read and reread for generations, each time offering something new to the reader. Consider <a href="/products/tale-two-cities-charles-dickens"><em>A Tale of Two Cities</em></a> by Charles Dickens, a novel that captures love, sacrifice, and redemption against the backdrop of the French Revolution. Then there’s <a href="/products/alices-adventures-wonderland-lewis-carroll"><em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em></a> by Lewis Carroll, an imaginative journey that still sparks wonder for both children and adults.</p><p>For those who enjoy exploring themes of creation and responsibility, <a href="/products/frankenstein-mary-wollstonecraft-shelley"><em>Frankenstein</em></a> by Mary Shelley is a groundbreaking story that mixes gothic horror with questions about humanity. Victor Hugo’s <a href="/products/notre-dame-de-paris-victor-hugo"><em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em></a> brings to life the majesty of medieval Paris while telling a story of tragedy and resilience. Finally, <a href="/products/adventures-sherlock-holmes-arthur-conan-doyle"><em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em></a> by Arthur Conan Doyle invites readers into a world of clever deductions, mysteries, and unforgettable characters.</p><p>Each of these works has endured because they continue to speak to readers across time. They’re not just important historically — they’re deeply enjoyable stories that remind us of the power of literature to connect, challenge, and inspire.</p>'
