      value: '<p>Every item in our homes has potential beyond function. A dining armchair in pink doesn’t just seat someone — it signals softness, boldness, or warmth. Objects evoke emotions, trigger stories, and become part of our living narratives.</p><p>Think about the contrast between a white &amp; wood chair and a flamboyant inflatable flamingo. The chair speaks of structure and permanence; the flamingo of whimsy and play. Even small pieces like a knit hat or décor accents reflect personal taste and mood.</p><p>When picking décor, ask: “How do I want to feel in the space?” Let your heart guide you as much as logic. Over time, a house filled only with “good deals” might feel hollow — but one curated with emotional resonance feels like home.</p><p>Ultimately, décor becomes expression when we root it in how we live, not just what looks good.</p>'

      summary: 'A chair, a stool, a lamp — they’re more than things. They carry emotion, memory, and identity.'
